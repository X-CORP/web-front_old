For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to Xymbi Corporation include www.xymbi.com and Xymbi. The Xymbi website is a news and information site. By using the Xymbi website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement. </p>
				<p><strong>Collection of your Personal Information </strong></p>             	
                <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information from our users. We may gather personal or non-personal information in the future. </p>
                <p>Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by Xymbi. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Xymbi website. </p>
                <p>Xymbi encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from Xymbi so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information.

                <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Xymbi pages, or register with Xymbi site or services, a cookie helps Xymbi to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Xymbi website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Xymbi features that you customized. </p>
                <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Xymbi services or websites you visit. </p>
